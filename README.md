# mccbble
MCCobble is an old vlc project of mine that I built for AFK cobblestone mining in minecraft using window-grabber.
It's one of my first ever computer programs ever. Unfortunately it no longer works even when compiled with CppBuilder+6 because I lost some files that were needed for it to run. But I still keep it as a reminder of the good old times
